# Hey!
I am a soon-to-be freshly minted computer science graduate from Rutgers University. In combining a rigorous academic experience with professional roles in the public and private sectors, I have exemplified my ability to troubleshoot difficult problems, collaborate on teams, and utilize development tools and software like React, Express, and Spring Boot at an advanced level. Recognized for improving engineering and operational optimization, I have a verifiable history of professional success as an intern, student, and worker. Professional focal points include UX/UI development, API development, database management, AI, machine learning, security, project management, and performance optimization. 

Most recently, I was a software engineer at Rocket Pharmaceuticals. In this capacity, I built a SOAP API application integrated with Docker and Jenkins that seamlessly processed data from over 20 PostgreSQL tables to optimize financial and inventory analytics. I also leveraged optimized queries to improve database performance, which reduced report loading times by 50%. In addition, I liaised with senior leadership, team members, and stakeholders to ensure the companyâ€™s technological support structure was fully functional to achieve established objectives.

Former professors and colleagues describe me as a dedicated, analytical, and highly driven software engineer who can be relied on to offer superior solutions that deliver results on time and under budget. 

I am pursuing new opportunities and can be reached through my LinkedIn.
